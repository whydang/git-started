His dad is overprotective and as a result, when the school went on a trip to the drop-off, he swam up to touch the butt, which really is just a boat. A diver happened to swim by and captured him for his little niece as a pet. In the aquarium he was placed in, he met some new friends who in the end helped him escape to find his dad.
